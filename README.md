## FAQ

- **Won't the editor just save over these?** - Apparently not.

- **Does the editor even support these?** - Yes.

- **Where is the background for X???** - Please refer to this gist: https://gist.github.com/LavenderTheGreat/608cbf5eee9665e59b842167becffde2

- **How do audio responsive backgrounds work?** - Razorsharp is note responsive, however New Year and Inject react to audio. Transitions are abitrary.

## Notes/Interest

- SunSurface is beta Inject, same with SandCrystals being possibly early SandCrystalsAfternoon. SunSurface is lower quality on sun bits but doesn't cycle beyond it.

- Gold objects in DarkSandCrystals Expert/XD clip through the camera ALWAYS.

- The XD bundle backgrounds also have clipping issues through the ceiling.
